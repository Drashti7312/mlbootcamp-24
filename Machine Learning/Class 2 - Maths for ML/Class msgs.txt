can you elaborate a bit more on this? you could simply employ multiple models, validate them to get best outcome
Suppose your domain knowledge states feature x is more important than y and z, does that imply you should provide more weightage to it or something?


can same data from multiple sources have contradicting info? 
but what if it contradicts? how is it handled? -> 


it means, y_pred is calculated/done on the basis of x_train……….. and we already have y_test. so we can compare how prediction value is approximately I==the result of y_test….  is it sir??

it may be silly from my side but shouldn't it be x_pred instead of y?
