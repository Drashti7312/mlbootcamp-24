    "- **True Negatives (TN)**: Emails correctly classified as ham (actual ham and predicted ham)\n",

    "\n",
    "From the classification matrix and report, we can see how well our classification model is performing. Depending on the application, we may prioritize certain metrics. For example, in spam detection, we may want to minimize false positives (emails incorrectly classified as spam), so precision would be an important metric. On the other hand, in medical diagnosis, we may want to minimize false negatives (missed diagnoses), so recall would be crucial."
