please explain, which plot is  for which kind of data...â€¦ if x and y both are numeric/continuous variable, we can plot scatter plot as well....



sir histogram and bar gralh me diff kya h?

bins = 30?

sir sns se kaam ho rhe h to matplotlib ki kya jarurat h?


sir, sns has pairplot and matplot  has subplot for  the same operation...?


sir fig, remove krke dekhna ek baar is it still working

Is object based approach more faster ? Or is it just used as it is more modular than individually using plt.subplots()?
