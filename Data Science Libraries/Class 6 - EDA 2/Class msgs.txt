some intuition will go into play that this feature can impact the outcome? - Intuition is wrong word, domain knowledge or expertise which becomes intuition is helpful.

Apart from that, researching and visualization/EDA is gonna help

yes..like a financial expert can tell about particular feature is important for target variable even when the correlation coefficient of that variable is small


Can you say EDA is a bottomless pit or sorts? Like when do you know what you've done is sufficient?

why you are putting f in starting while doing this?


sir usually how much time is given for EDA during project roughly 3 days to analyse
