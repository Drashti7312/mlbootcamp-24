    "\n",
    "Create a Python class named `Calculator` with the following specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The class should have a constructor method (`__init__`) that initializes two attributes: `num1` and `num2`.\n",
    "2. Implement a function named `add` that takes no arguments and returns the sum of `num1` and `num2`.\n",
    "3. Implement a function named `subtract` that takes no arguments and returns the result of subtracting `num2` from `num1`.\n",
    "4. Implement a function named `multiply` that takes a single argument `factor` and returns the product of `num1` and `factor`.\n",
